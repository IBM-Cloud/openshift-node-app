# Scalable web application on OpenShift

This starter application is a simple microservice that incorporates the [Express web framework](https://expressjs.com/) to provide a landing page and two endpoints. Use this repository as a template for your own application.

A microservice is an individual component of an application that follows the **microservice architecture** - an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, each of which implements business capability. The microservice exposes a RESTful API matching a [Swagger](http://swagger.io) definition.

You can access the cloud native microservice capabilities at the following endpoints:
- The [Swagger UI](http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) is running on: `/swagger/api-docs`
- Health endpoint: `/health`

The microservice is ready to run locally in a Docker container or with the Node.js runtime that is hosted on your local operating system.
